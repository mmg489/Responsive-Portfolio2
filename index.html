                <p> Margarita Munoz is a Georgia State University graduate. She pursued a degree in International Economics and Modern Languages.
                    Driven by her passion for foreign languages, she pursued her B.S. to further her studies in French, and stumbled into a love for Economics. 
                    Intrigued by the relationships between people, culture, and finances she delved into the many disciplines and schools of thought within economics. 
                    However, after graduation she spent several years in the accounting field, and realized it was not something she wanted to continue to grow in.

                    Growing up in the 90's allowed her to watch the internet grow and become what it has. She appreciated how dynamic and revolutionary it is when paired with traditional education. 
                    As a kid, countless hours were spent tweaking and playing around with basic HTML codes to perfect her "Myspace" profile, unknowningly messing with barebones markup language in her free time.
                    Pairing those experiences with her love of learning languages steered her in the direction of the Georgia Institute of Technology's coding bootcamp. 
                    As an Atlanta native with a love for technology, a love for her city, and for learning and challenging herself it was a perfect match. Now growing and learning to navigate the tech space has been a roller coaster experience.
                    She continues her pursuit of sharpening the tools she is being exposed to within her full stack bootcamp, and looks forward to leaving her stamp on the world of web development.
